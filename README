Cagibi is a personal dropbox-like service. Its goal is to synchronize a folder
between a server and many clients. It uses the rsync algorithm to do so.

Testing
=======

To test cagibi locally, you'll have to cd into tests/server and run the 
"runserver" script. After that, cd into tests/client and run "runclient". 
Any changes to the "client_dir" directory should be reflected on the server.

Limitations
===========

For the time, cagibi only supports files, not folders.

Why Cagibi ?
============

In french, a cagibi is a very small space where you store stuff.
