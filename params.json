{"body":"Cagibi is a personal dropbox-like service. Its goal is to synchronize a folder\r\nbetween a server and many clients. It uses the rsync algorithm to do so.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTo test cagibi locally, you'll have to cd into tests/server and run the \r\n\"runserver\" script. After that, cd into tests/client and run \"runclient\". \r\nAny changes to the \"client_dir\" directory should be reflected on the server.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n===========\r\n\r\nFor the time, cagibi only supports files, not folders.\r\n\r\nWhy Cagibi ?\r\n============\r\n\r\nIn french, a cagibi is a very small space where you store stuff.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
